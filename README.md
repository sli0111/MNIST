### Introduction

In this tutorial, we will introduce the MNIST dataset and show how to use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, and Logisitic Regression to classify images as digits.

The inference problem is:

* given handwritten images of vector X
* classify the images as digits between 0-9 as y

### What is MNIST? 

MNIST is a large dataset of handwritten images often used for image processing models.  The dataset contains over 60,000 images of 28x28 pixels.
